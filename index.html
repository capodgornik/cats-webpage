            I have four beautiful cats:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> <a href="#pierre"> Pierre </a> </li>
            <li> <a href="#roryinky"> Rory </a> </li>
            <li> <a href="#roryinky"> Inky </a> </li>
            <li> <a href="#madison"> Madison </a> </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            <strong> Pierre </strong> and <strong> Madison </strong> are both 6 years old, 
            <strong> Rory </strong> is 3 years old, and <strong> Inky </strong> is 4 years old.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Pierre lets me dress him up! 
        </p>
        <p id="pierre"> 
            <img src="pierre_crown.JPG" alt = "pierre in a crown" height="350" width = "350" />
            <img src="pierre_watergun.JPG" alt = "pierre with a watergun" height="350" width = "350" />
        </p>
        
        <p>
            When Pierre and Madison were younger they got along great! They would cuddle like this all the time:
        </p>
        <p id="madison">
            <img src="pierre_madison.JPG" alt = "pierre and madison" height="503" width = "585" />        
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that they're older, they usually pretend like they don't know each other :( <br /> But I still
            have hope that they'll be buddies again one day!
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Inky and Rory, however, are pretty much inseparable:
        </p>
        <p id="roryinky">
            <img src="inky_rory.JPG" alt = "inky and rory" height="500" width = "500" />        
        </p>  
        
        <p>
            I adopted Inky and Rory from the vet that I take my cats to, <a href= "https://felineltd.com/" > Feline Ltd</a>. My cats all 
            love Dr. Upchurch! <br /> The Feline Ltd. <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/Feline-Ltd-Cat-Clinic-197906626902923/" > 
            Facebook page</a> always has pictures of the cats that are up for adoption.
